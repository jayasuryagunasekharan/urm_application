            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>As the largest university in North Texas and second largest in The University of
                Texas System, UTA is located in the heart of Dallas-Fort Worth, challenging our students to
                engage with the world around them in ways that make a measurable impact.

                UTA offers state-of-the-art facilities that encourage students to be critical thinkers. Through
                academic, internship, and research programs, our students receive real-world experiences that
                help them contribute to their community and, ultimately, the world.

                We have more than 180 baccalaureate, master's, and doctoral degree programs, and more than
                41,000 students walking our campus or engaging in online coursework each year.
